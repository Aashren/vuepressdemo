In this chapter, we will discuss, about satellite mission design and all the subsections that needs to be addressed before mission development or production. For a CubeSat to function propery, firstly, the designers and the engineers must be clear on what they expect out of the satellite. They must haVe a clear objective on where the satellite will be deployed, what it will do; how would the data it collects contribute to the current data pool; how feasible is the mission given the SWaP requirements; why is the mission being designed and how will the designers or the engineers obtain the outcome that they expect to get out of that system. A proper mission design plan helps answer all these aforementioned questions and also provide a robust roadmap for the development and production of the mission. Experts suggest keeping the mission plan simple and less convoluted as that could pose problems in the production phase of the satellite.</p><p>      Apart from technical limitations and budgetary limitations, there can also be a social limitation while production of CubeSats. When engineers or designers from developing countries build a satellite, there are different parts that they must address. All the designing procedure must be carried with meticulous attention to detail, for outcome of this process will be deployed in space. Here in this chapter, we will try and cover all the aspects that one has to be aware before making a satellite.</p><br><h2 id="_2-2-bus-systems" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-2-bus-systems"><span>2.2 Bus Systems</span></a></h2><br><p>The bus system in a CubeSat refers to the various subsystems and components that make up the satellite, such as the power system, communication system, and control system. These subsystems work together to allow the CubeSat to perform its intended mission. In this section, we will discuss the importance of the bus system in a CubeSat, the different subsystems that make up the bus system, and the requirements that need to be followed while designing the bus system. The bus system of a CubeSat plays a crucial role in the satellite’s overall design and functionality. It provides the necessary infrastructure and support for the subsystems and payloads, ensures the satellite’s structural integrity, thermal control, and safety, provides means of propulsion, enables communication and control, and allows for flexibility and scalability. A well-designed bus system is essential for the successful operation of a CubeSat. The bus system should be designed with tacit scalability, flexibility, reliability, cost-effectiveness, and safety in mind. A bus system in a CubeSat also refers to the various subsystems and components that make up the satellite, such as the power system, communication system, and control system. These subsystems work together to allow the CubeSat to perform its intended mission.</p><p>      It is important to understand the difference between the bus system and the subsystems. A subsystem is a specific component or group of components that make up the CubeSat, such as the power system or the communication system. The bus system, on the other hand, is the overall infrastructure that supports and connects the subsystems. It provides the necessary support for the subsystems to function, and enables communication and control of the subsystems.</p><p>    The importance of a well-designed bus system in a CubeSat includes:</p><ul><li>Enabling the satellite to function properly and perform its mission,</li><li>Allowing for the integration of various payloads or scientific instruments,</li><li>Facilitating communication and control of the satellite from the ground,</li><li>Ensuring the power needs of the satellite and its subsystems are met,</li><li>Providing a stable platform for the payloads to operate on</li><li>Minimizing the cost of the satellite and so on.</li></ul><p>     A well-designed bus system can help to ensure the CubeSat is reliable and performs as expected, which is crucial for successful scientific missions or commercial applications. It is also responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of the satellite, providing thermal control, and ensuring the safety of the satellite during launch and operation. The bus system is also responsible for providing the CubeSat with a means of propulsion, (such as through the use of a thruster), which is essential for controlling the satellite’s attitude and orbit. The bus system is also responsible for providing the CubeSat with a means of communicating with the ground and other satellites. This is typically done through the use of a transceiver, which allows the CubeSat to send and receive data and commands. The communication subsystem is a critical component of the bus system, as it allows the CubeSat to be operated and controlled remotely, and to transmit along with the transmission of real time data back to Earth. Another important aspect of the CubeSat bus system is its flexibility and scalability. CubeSats are modular in design, meaning that they can be easily expanded or contracted to suit the needs of a particular mission. This is made possible by the bus system, which provides a standardized interface for connecting different subsystems and payloads. This makes it easier to add new subsystems or payloads to the satellite without having to redesign the entire system.</p><p>     In summary, the bus system of a CubeSat plays a crucial role in the satellite’s overall design and functionality. It provides the necessary infrastructure and support for the subsystems and payloads, ensures the satellite’s structural integrity, thermal control, and safety, provides movement through the means of propulsion characteristics, enables communication and control, and allows for flexibility and scalability. A well-designed bus system is essential for the successful operation of a CubeSat. <br></p><h2 id="_2-3-subsystems" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-3-subsystems"><span>2.3 Subsystems</span></a></h2><br><p>     Subsystems of a satellite generally refers to the various functional components or modules that make up a satellite. These subsystems are specialized units within the satellite that perform specific tasks and work together to ensure the satellite’s proper functioning and mission accomplishment. Just like a human body, a satellite is composed of several interconnected systems, each with its own unique purpose and functionality. Hence, the term subsystem also touches upon the modular nature of satellite design and it’s understanding. These subsystems are often developed and integrated separately, but they must work in harmony to achieve the overall mission objectives of the satellite. While talking about the subsystems, the focus is on the different areas of expertise and engineering disciplines involved in satellite design and operation. It acknowledges that each subsystem requires specialized knowledge and skill sets, including power systems, communication systems, attitude control, thermal control, command and data handling, structure, propulsion, and payload.</p><p>     Understanding and managing the interactions and interfaces between these subsystems are crucial for a successful satellite mission. Proper coordination and integration of these subsystems ensure that the satellite can generate power, communicate with the ground, maintain its desired attitude, manage temperature, process data, withstand structural loads, maneuver in space, and fulfill its specific mission objectives. In summary, when someone mentions &quot;satellite subsystems,&quot; they are referring to the individual components and systems that together form a complete satellite and perform specific functions necessary for its operation and mission success.</p><p>    A satellite is made up of several subsystems, and they are listed below:</p><ul><li>Electrical Power System (EPS)</li><li>Structure System</li><li>Communication System</li><li>ADCS</li><li>OBC System</li><li>Thermal System</li><li>Payload System <br></li></ul><h3 id="_2-3-1-electric-power-system" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-3-1-electric-power-system"><span>2.3.1 Electric Power System</span></a></h3><br><p>The EPS is a crucial subsystem for the proper functioning of a CubeSat. It is responsible for collecting, storing, and distributing the electrical power needed by other systems on the satellite to operate effectively. The EPS is also responsible for monitoring the overall health of the satellite, and protecting it and its subsystems from the high levels of radiation in space.</p><p>Below we discuss about the most important of EPS:</p><ul><li><p><b>Power Sources:</b>The primary source of power for a CubeSat’s EPS is energy collected from solar panels. These panels are typically made of photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight into electrical energy. The solar panels are typically mounted on the exterior of the CubeSat, and are designed to track the sun as the CubeSat orbits the Earth, in order to maximize the amount of energy collected. In addition to solar panels, CubeSats also typically include rechargeable batteries to store the energy collected by the solar panels. These batteries are used to provide power to the CubeSat during periods when it is not in direct sunlight, such as during eclipses or when it is in the Earth’s shadow. The batteries also provide a buffer to smooth out any variations in the power supply from the solar panels, and provide power during periods of peak demand by the payload on-board the CubeSat.</p></li><li><p><b>Power Control and Distribution: </b>The EPS is responsible for regulating and distributing the power collected and stored by the solar panels and batteries to other systems throughout the CubeSat as needed. This is done through a power control and distribution unit. The power control and distribution unit is responsible for monitoring the power supply from the solar panels and batteries, and distributing the power to the various subsystems of the CubeSat as needed. It also includes a power conditioning unit, which is responsible for converting the power supply from the solar panels and batteries into the appropriate voltage levels for different systems and sensors.</p></li><li><p><b>Monitoring and Protection: </b>The EPS also plays an important role in monitoring the overall health of the CubeSat. This includes collecting routine information from various subsystems and sensors, such as voltages, currents, and temperatures, and communicating this information back to the ground as part of the telemetry for the CubeSat operators to monitor the overall health of the system and guard against potential faults or poor performance. The high levels of radiation in space can cause ”single event latch-up” in the semiconductor devices on the CubeSat, this can damage some of the components on the CubeSat if the power is not turned off quickly enough. To protect against this, the EPS also includes overcurrent and overvoltage protection circuits to protect the CubeSat and its subsystems from these events.</p></li></ul><p><b> Electrical Requirements</b></p><p>In order to ensure the safety of the CubeSat during launch and operation, there are certain electrical requirements that are recommended for the standard CubeSat form factor that EPS should adhere to. These include:</p><ul><li><p>No electronics may be active during launch to prevent any electrical or RF interference with the launch vehicle and primary payloads. CubeSats with rechargeable batteries must be fully deactivated during launch or launch with discharged batteries.</p></li><li><p>One deployment switch is required (two are recommended) for each CubeSat. The deployment switch should be located at designated points.</p></li><li><p>Developers who wish to perform testing and battery charging after integration must provide ground support equipment (GSE) that connects to the CubeSat through designated data ports.</p></li><li><p>A remove before flight (RBF) pin is required to deactivate the CubeSats during integration outside the Poly-PicoSatellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD). The pin will be removed once the CubeSats are placed inside the P-POD. RBF pins must fit within the designated data ports without protruding more than 6.5 mm from the rails when fully inserted.</p></li><li><p>A remove before flight (RBF) pin is required to deactivate the CubeSats during integration outside the Poly-PicoSatellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD). The pin will be removed once the CubeSats are placed inside the P-POD.

It is responsible for collecting, storing, and distributing power, monitoring the overall health of the satellite, and protecting it and its subsystems from the high levels of radiation in space. The EPS must also adhere to certain electrical requirements to ensure the safety of the CubeSat during launch and operation, while also being designed to minimize power consumption and maximize energy efficiency to extend the CubeSat’s lifespan in orbit.</p><br><h3 id="_2-3-2-structure-system" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-3-2-structure-system"><span>2.3.2 Structure System</span></a></h3><br><p>A structure sub-system in a cubesat refers to the physical framework of the satellite, which includes the frame, body, and other structural components that hold the various subsystems in place and provide protection for the satellite during launch and operation. This subsystem is critical for maintaining the structural integrity of the CubeSats and ensuring it can withstand the various forces and stresses it will encounter in space. The structure subsystem is extremely important in CubeSats, as it provides the basic framework for the rest of the satellite’s subsystems and enables the satellite to maintain its shape and integrity in space.</p><p>    In humans, the structural system is made up of the body itself, including the skeleton, muscles, and skin. The skeleton provides support for the body, while the muscles allow for movement, and the skin protects the internal organs from external shocks. Similarly, in satellites, the structural subsystem serves two main roles: to protect the internal equipment so that it can withstand launch and the space environment, and to support the internal equipment so that it can function. The structural subsystem provides the physical framework for the satellite, and includes the frame, body, and other structural components that hold the various subsystems in place and provide protection for the satellite during launch and operation.</p><p>    The structural subsystem is critical for maintaining the structural integrity of the satellite and ensuring it can withstand the various forces and stresses it will encounter in space. The structural subsystem must also be able to withstand the forces encountered during launch and deployment, such as vibrations, acceleration, and shock. The structural subsystem is essential for the safe and successful operation of a satellite in space.</p><p>    Unlike conventional satellites, while designing a CubeSat structure system, we have to keep in account of the SWaP requirements. Also, as nano- and pico-satellites are not actually the primary payloads of a launcher and are merely piggybacking loads, the launchers also have their own set of requirements or restrictions. discussing the structural system of a satellite, one must also pay attention to these key aspects that are listed and briefly explained below:</p><ul><li><p><b>CubeSat Structure:</b> The structure of a CubeSat typically consists of an aluminum or carbon fiber composite chassis, also known as the &quot;CubeSat structure&quot; or &quot;bus.&quot; The structure provides a rigid framework and mounting points for integrating the various subsystems and payloads. It is designed to be lightweight and compact while ensuring adequate structural integrity during launch and in space.</p></li><li><p><b>Panels and Rails</b> CubeSat structures often include removable panels and rails on the external faces of the chassis. These panels can be opened or removed to access the internal components during integration or maintenance. The rails provide attachment points for subsystems, such as power systems, communication systems, and sensors.</p></li><li><p><b>Deployable Solar Panels:</b> Many CubeSats are equipped with deployable solar panels to generate electrical power. These solar panels are typically stored in a folded configu- ration and are deployed once the CubeSat is in orbit. The solar panels provide energy to the onboard systems and recharge the batteries.</p></li><li><p><b>Antenna Deployment:</b> CubeSats require antennas for communication purposes. The antennas may be deployed through various mechanisms, such as tape springs or shape memory alloys, to extend them from the compact form to their operational configuration after launch.</p></li><li><p><b>Vibration and Shock Mitigation</b> CubeSats must withstand the vibrations and shocks experienced during launch. To mitigate these forces, the structure incorporates shock mounts, vibration isolators, and other damping mechanisms. These components help protect the CubeSat’s sensitive subsystems and payloads from damage.</p></li><li><p><b>Integration and Testing:</b> CubeSat structure systems undergo rigorous integration and testing processes to ensure their functionality and reliability. The integration involves securely mounting the subsystems and payloads onto the structure while considering proper alignment and interfaces. Testing includes mechanical and thermal vacuum tests to validate the structure’s performance under expected environmental conditions.</p></li><li><p><b>Standardized Mechanical Interfaces:</b> CubeSats use standardized mechanical interfaces, such as the P-POD or NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer (NRCSD), for deployment from the launch vehicle.

This system is crucial for the CubeSat mission, as it allows the CubeSat to communicate with the ground station and transmit data and telemetry. The com- munication system typically consists of antennas, transceivers, modulation and demodulation units and a communication protocol such as AX.25 for packet radio communication. The transceiver is responsible for sending and receiving data, while the antenna is responsible for transmitting and receiving signals. The communication protocol is responsible for ensuring that the data is transmitted and received correctly. This chapter will provide an in-depth understanding of the communication subsystem in CubeSats, including its components, design considerations, and best practices.</p><p>The role of the communication subsystem is to facilitate communication between the CubeSat and the ground station. This includes receiving uplinked commands from the ground station and downlinking housekeeping and mission data to the ground station. An example of this would be a CubeSat receiving a command to take a picture from its onboard camera, and then transmitting the picture back to the ground station for analysis.</p><p>The communication subsystem must be able to transmit and receive data at the necessary speeds and frequencies, and it must be able to operate within the power and weight constraints of the CubeSat. Additionally, the subsystem must be able to withstand the harsh conditions of space, such as radiation and temperature extremes. An example of this would be a CubeSat communication subsystem that is designed to operate at temperatures ranging from -40 to 85 degrees Celsius and has a radiation tolerance of 50 krad.</p><p>The packet data communication protocol is responsible for ensuring the correct transmission and receipt of data. This includes selecting the appropriate protocol, such as AX.25, and determining the necessary packet size and transmission rate. An example of this would be using a packet size of 256 bytes and a transmission rate of 9600 baud for a CubeSat with limited data storage capacity.</p><p>The data transmission speed between the ground station and the CubeSat is determined based on the CubeSat’s mission requirements and the capabilities of the communication equipment. Factors such as the distance between the ground station and the CubeSat, the size of the data to be transmitted, and the desired transmission rate are taken into account when calculating the data transmission speed. An example of this would be a CubeSat in low Earth orbit that needs to transmit high-resolution images back to the ground station at a rate of 1Mbps.</p><p><b>Ground Stations</b></p><p>Ground stations are the ground-based facilities that are used to communicate with and control CubeSats. They include the necessary equipment, such as antennas and receivers to communicate with the CubeSat, as well as the software and hardware to process the data received from the CubeSat. An example of a ground station would be a facility located at a high altitude, where the atmospheric conditions are optimal for communication with a CubeSat in low Earth orbit.</p><p>The design process of a ground station includes determining the required communication capabilities, such as data transmission speed and frequency, as well as selecting the appro- priate communication equipment and software. The design also includes considerations for the ground station’s location, such as its proximity to the CubeSat’s orbit and the availability of power and internet connections. A ground station must have the necessary equipment and software to communicate with the CubeSat, such as antennas, receivers, and processing software. It must also have a reliable power source and internet connection. Additionally, the ground station must be located in an area with a clear line of sight to the CubeSat’s orbit.</p><p><b>Antenna and Link Budgets</b></p><p>The design of the CubeSat antenna is a crucial aspect of the communication subsystem. The antenna must be able to transmit and receive signals at the necessary frequencies and with the required gain. Factors such as the CubeSat’s orbit, the size and weight constraints of the CubeSat, and the desired communication range must be taken into account when designing the antenna. For example, a CubeSat in a low Earth orbit may require a small, lightweight antenna with a lower gain, while a CubeSat in a higher orbit may require a larger, more powerful antenna with a higher gain.</p><p>Link budget is the calculation of the amount of power required at the transmitter and the sensitivity required at the receiver to establish a successful communication link. It includes factors such as the transmitter power, the receiver sensitivity, the path loss, and the atmospheric conditions. The link budget design is an important step in the communication subsystem design process, as it helps to ensure that the CubeSat will be able to communicate effectively with the ground station.</p><p>The communication method and frequency used by a CubeSat will depend on the mission requirements and the available communication equipment. Factors such as the desired data transmission rate, the CubeSat’s orbit, and the availability of frequencies must be taken into account when determining the communication method and frequency. An example of this would be a CubeSat in a low Earth orbit that uses UHF frequencies for communication, while a CubeSat in a higher orbit may use S-band or X-band frequencies.</p><p><b>Communication Standards</b></p><p>There are various communication standards that have been developed specifically for Cube- Sats, such as the CubeSat Space Protocol (CSP) and the CubeSat Communication Protocol (CCP). These standards provide guidelines for the design and operation of the communication subsystem and can help to ensure compatibility between different CubeSats and ground stations. Error correction and data compression are important techniques that can be used to improve the efficiency and reliability of the communication subsystem. Error correction techniques, such as forward error correction (FEC), can be used to detect and correct errors that may occur during data transmission. Data compression techniques, such as lossless or lossy compression, can be used to reduce the size of the data being transmitted, which can help to increase the data transmission speed.</p><p>Security is a critical aspect of the communication subsystem, as it ensures the integrity and confidentiality of the data being transmitted. This can include encryption techniques, such as AES, to protect against unauthorized access, and authentication methods, such as digital signatures, to ensure that the data is coming from a trusted source.</p><p>In conclusion, the communication subsystem in CubeSats plays a vital role in the successful operation of the satellite. The subsystem must be designed to meet the mission requirements while also taking into account the CubeSat’s size and resource constraints. By understanding the components, design considerations, and best practices for communication subsystems in CubeSats, engineers and scientists can ensure that their CubeSat missions are successful. <br></p><h3 id="_2-3-4-adcs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-3-4-adcs"><span>2.3.4 ADCS</span></a></h3><br><p>The ADCS is responsible for maintaining the CubeSat’s orientation in space and pointing its payload in the correct direction.

Attitude control involves adjusting the satellite’s orientation to achieve desired pointing directions or stability.</p><p>While designing a functional ADCS, a system that senses its position or attitude should be designed. That is the first step. Then, should the sensed data not be favorable, an actuator should be employed to maintain the desired position and an algorithm must be made as such that the whole system maintains itself, as a system, without any external influence.

Commonly used actuators include:</p><ul><li><em>Reaction wheels</em>: These spinning wheels can change the satellite’s angular momentum by accelerating or decelerating their rotation. By controlling the angular momentum, the CubeSat’s orientation can be adjusted.</li><li><em>Magnetorquers</em>: These devices use electromagnetic forces generated by onboard electromagnets to interact with the Earth’s magnetic field. By selectively activating the magnetorquers, the CubeSat can generate torque and control its orientation.</li><li><em>Thrusters</em>: In some cases, CubeSats may be equipped with small thrusters that use compressed gas or electric propulsion to provide additional attitude control capabilities.</li></ul></li><li><p><b>Control Algorithms:</b> ADCS incorporates control algorithms to calculate the necessary actuator commands based on the desired attitude and the measured attitude. These algorithms aim to minimize the error between the desired attitude and the actual attitude, providing stable and accurate control</p></li><li><p><b>Power and Communication:</b> ADCS also requires power and communication links to operate. It is typically connected to the CubeSat&#39;s power supplu and onboard computer system for data processing and actuator control. The ADC system may also interface with the CubeSat&#39;s communication subsystem to receive commands and provide attitude-related telemetry data to the ground station.</p></li></ul><p>The ADCS plays a critical role in CubeSat missions that require precise pointing, imaging, or data acquisition. It enables the satellite to maintain a desired orientation, stabilize its attitude, or adjust its pointing direction for scientific observations, Earth imaging, or communication purposes.</p><br><h3 id="_2-3-5-obc-system" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-3-5-obc-system"><span>2.3.5 OBC System</span></a></h3><br><p>The OBC system is a crucial component of any CubeSat mission, serving as the central control unit for the satellite’s avionics and payload systems.

Additionally, more advanced software and operating systems, such as real-time operating system (RTOS), are being used to improve the reliability and performance of OBCs.</p><p>The hardware used in an OBC typically includes a microprocessor, memory banks, and an interfacing chip to connect the computer to other subsystems. A range of standard and non-standard interface formats are used, such as RS485, CAN, SpaceWire, SPI, and I2C. The OBC can be provided as an integrated unit in the CubeSat bus and avionics system or as a modular device that can work with various other pieces of multi-vendor equipment. The software used in an OBC typically includes a RTOS that manages all the software applications and provides the flight software for the CubeSat. Popular RTOSs used in CubeSat OBCs include FreeRTOS, which is free, open-source, lightweight, and compatible with a wide range of microcontroller types.</p><p><b>Role of OBCs in CubeSats</b></p><p>The OBC plays several key roles in the effective operation of a CubeSat.

It is also important to consider the use of industry standards such as the CubeSat Design Specification (CDS) and the CubeSat Bus Standard (CSBS). Adhering to these standards can help ensure that the OBC is compatible with other CubeSat subsystems and can be easily integrated into the overall CubeSat design. Another important aspect to consider is the development process, it should include a detailed requirements analysis, design, implementation, and verification phases. This process should be carried out with a high degree of collaboration between the different teams involved in the project, such as the mechanical, electrical, and software teams.</p><p>In addition, the OBC hardware and software should be thoroughly tested before launch to ensure that it will work as intended in the space environment. This includes testing for radiation tolerance, thermal cycling, vibration, and shock.These requirements include:</p><ul><li><p><b>Processing capability:</b> The OBC must have sufficient processing power to handle the demands of the CubeSat’s payload and subsystems.</p></li><li><p><b>Memory:</b> The OBC must have enough memory to store the data generated by the CubeSat’s payload and subsystems, as well as any housekeeping data.</p></li><li><p><b>Interoperability and interfacing capabilities:</b> The OBC must be able to interface effectively with the CubeSat’s other subsystems, such as the power distribution system and the communication system.</p></li><li><p><b>Reliability of software:</b> The software running on the OBC must be reliable to ensure that the CubeSat can operate effectively.</p></li><li><p><b>Power requirements:</b> The OBC must be able to operate within the power constraints of the CubeSat.</p></li><li><p><b>Size and weight:</b> The OBC must be small and lightweight enough to fit within the 1U CubeSat’s mass and volume constraints.</p></li><li><p><b>Radiation tolerance:</b> The OBC must be able to withstand the harsh radiation environment of space without suffering any damage or degradation in performance.</p></li><li><p><b>Single point of failure (SPOF):</b> The OBC should be designed in such a way that it is able to withstand a SPOF without compromising the overall functionality of the CubeSat.</p></li><li><p><b>Thermal management:</b> The OBC must be able to operate within the CubeSat’s thermal constraints, which can vary depending on the CubeSat’s orbit and orientation.</p></li><li><p><b>Power manangement:</b> The OBC must be able to effectively manage the power consump- tion of the CubeSat’s subsystems, in order to ensure that the CubeSat can operate for the duration of its mission.</p></li><li><p><b>Fault tolerance:</b> The OBC must be able to tolerate faults in the CubeSat’s subsystems and continue to operate effectively.</p></li><li><p><b>Security:</b> The OBC must be designed with security in mind, to protect the CubeSat against cyber-attacks and unauthorized access.</p></li></ul><br><h3 id="_2-3-6-thermal-system" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-3-6-thermal-system"><span>2.3.6 Thermal System</span></a></h3><br><p>The thermal subsystem in a CubeSat is responsible for managing and regulating the satellite’s temperature in the harsh environment of space.

The altitude, orbital shape, and angle with the equatorial plane are all important parameters that can affect a CubeSat&#39;s capabilities and performance. Altitude is a key factor in determining a CubeSat&#39;s field of view and ground resolution. A CubeSat in a higher orbit will have a wider field of view but lower resolution, while a CubeSat in a lower orbit will have a higher resolution but a more limited field of view. Inclination is also an important factor in determining a CubeSat&#39;s coverage area.

The orbit&#39;s characteristics mainly depends on the objective or tasks the satellite needs to accomplish. Hence, an effective orbit lets the engineers to position their satellites accordingly. The basic parameters that help us design an effective orbit are called the Keplerian elements. They are a set of parameters used to describe the orbit of a satellite or celestial body around another object, such as a planet or a star. There are six main Keplerian elements: <ul><li><p><b>Semi-major axis (a):</b> This element represents half the length of the longest diameter of the elliptical orbit. It describes the size of the orbit and determines the average distance between the satellite and the object it is orbiting.</p></li><li><p><b>Eccentricity (e):</b> Eccentricity measures the shape of the orbit. It tells us how elongated or circular the orbit is. An eccentricity of 0 represents a perfect circle, while an eccentricity closer to 1 represents a more elongated orbit.</p></li><li><p><b>Inclination (i):</b> Inclination is the angle between the orbital plane of the satellite and a reference plane, usually the equatorial plane of the object being orbited. It determines how tilted the orbit is with respect to the reference plane.</p></li><li><p><b>Right Ascension of the Ascending Node (Ω):</b> This element represents the angle between the reference direction (usually the vernal equinox) and the point where the satellite’s orbit crosses the reference plane from below. It defines the orientation of the orbital plane in space.</p></li><li><p><b>Argument of Perigee ( ω )</b> The argument of perigee is the angle between the ascending node and the point of closest approach to the central object, called the perigee. It defines the orientation of the satellite within its orbit.</p></li><li><p><b>Mean Anomaly (M):</b> The mean anomaly represents the angular position of the satellite along its orbit at a specific point in time. It helps determine the satellite’s position within its orbit based on time.</p></li></ul><p>By combining these elements, we can precisely define the shape, size, and orientation of an orbit. These elements are used in orbital calculations, mission planning, and tracking satellites in space.

The launchers also require evidences of several tests performed in a satellite so that the CubeSat is not a liability and doesn’t actively effect the primary payload that it is hitching the ride from. There are several types of testing and analysis that are typically required for a 1U CubeSat structure, including:</p><ul><li><b>Structural testing:</b> This type of testing is used to verify the structural integrity of the CubeSat structure and its ability to withstand the loads and vibrations that it will experience during launch.

This allows for opti- mization of the thermal design and identification of potential thermal failure points.</li></ul><p>It’s important to note that the CubeSat structure should be designed in a way that allows for easy access for testing, maintenance and repair and also it should be designed in a way that it can be easily integrated into different payloads or subsystems. In addition to the testing and analysis mentioned above, there are several other considerations that should be taken into account when designing a 1U CubeSat structure. These include:</p><ul><li><p><em>Design margins</em>: The structure should be designed with adequate margins to ensure that it can withstand the loads and environments it will experience during launch and on-orbit operations.</p></li><li><p><em>Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)/ Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)</em>: The structure should be designed to minimize EMI and EMC issues, which can affect the performance of electronic subsystems.</p></li><li><p><em>Outgassing</em>: The structure should be designed to minimize outgassing, which can contaminate other spacecraft and instruments.</p></li><li><p><em>Mass and volume constraints</em>: The structure should be designed to be as lightweight and compact as possible, to maximize the available volume for other subsystems and payloads.</p></li><li><p><em>Compatibility with launch vehicles and dispensers</em>: The structure should be designed to be compatible with the launch vehicle and dispenser that will be used for launch.</p></li><li><p><em>Cost</em>: The structure should be designed to minimize costs, while still meeting all of the requirements for the mission.</p></li><li><p><em>Durability</em>: The structure should be designed to withstand the harsh environment of space and last for the duration of the mission, taking into account the factors such as radiation, thermal and mechanical loads.</p></li><li><p><em>Space debris</em>: The structure should be designed to minimize the risk of creating space debris, by ensuring that all parts remain attached to the CubeSat during launch, ejection and operation.</p></li><li><p><em>Standardization</em>: The structure should be designed to be compliant with relevant stan- dards and regulations, such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), European Space Agency (ESA) CubeSat standards.</p></li></ul><p>Overall, designing a 1U CubeSat structure requires a balance between competing require- ments, such as mass, volume, cost, and performance. The design process should be iterative, with multiple rounds of testing and analysis to optimize the design and ensure that it meets all of the requirements for the mission. <br></p><h2 id="_2-6-recommendations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-6-recommendations"><span>2.6 Recommendations</span></a></h2><br><p>Most of satellite mission designers and engineers follow the quote by William of Ockham while thinking about their satellite mission. In his Summa Totius Logicae [7], William of Ockham cites the principle of economy, Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora (&quot;It is futile to do with more things that which can be done with fewer&quot;; Thorburn, 1918, pp. 352–53; Kneale and Kneale, 1962, p. 243.) In other words, it is recommended that we don’t complicate the process of designing just for the sake of designing. It comes to us, the designers, to ensure that the mission is fairly simple and effective. The redundant systems, should be kept to minimum. A system with high number of redundant subsystems would cause nothing but issues in the long haul. One has to be absolutely certain what do they expect from the mission and how to accomplish it.</p><p>The objective of the mission should be known and all the subsystems must be designed in such a way that fulfills the objective. Most of times, a tradeoff must be made, in order to manage the expectations from the system. Sometimes the newest or the most advanced system is not required to get the outcome required from a mission, that is where one has to do tradeoff where they (the designers) purposefully choose a less advanced system to adhere to the constraints (SWaP or budgetary or launcher or any other) and make sure the system still functions perfectly. Also, while designing a mission, one has to also be specifically aware of the SWaP requirements of CubeSats. Most often, the designers get carried away with the fact that they are making a satellite and dream big. It is a fair assumption and also the enthusiasm of making a satellite trumps the realistic situation. One has to be grounded with the fact that there are fairly less things to be done in a 1U satellite than the conventional satellite. If, that fact is processed initially, that would also save us from a lot of disappointment in the days of mission design.</p><p>While designing the orbit, one also has to be aware of the launcher requirements and work with them. An orbit has to be designed in a way that also performs amicably with good results and also adhere to the launcher’s requirements. That becomes an important part. Also, depending on the mission, temporal and spatial resolution of the satellite must be also considered. As orbit also contributes directly to the charging of the batteries (sunfacing time and eclipse times), that too has to be considered and must be designed in the most feasible way so that everything works effectively. The ground station passing time and the link budget also has to be looked into and has to be designed effectively so that the designers encounter the least disturbances.</p></div></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="vp-page-meta"><!----><div class="vp-meta-item git-info"><div class="vp-meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="vp-meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: aashrenmanandhar05@gmail.com">Aashren</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></div></footer><nav class="vp-page-nav" aria-label="page navigation"><a class="route-link prev" href="/Introduction.html" aria-label="Introduction"><!--[--><div class="hint"><span class="arrow left"></span> Prev</div><div class="link"><span>Introduction</span></div><!--]--></a><a class="route-link next" href="/ECube.html" aria-label="ECube"><!--[--><div class="hint">Next <span class="arrow right"></span></div><div class="link"><span>ECube</span></div><!--]--></a></nav><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!--[--><!----><!--]--><!--]--></div>
