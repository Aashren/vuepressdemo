We will also familirize ourselves with different types of satellite missions. We will also have an overview of CubeSats and how they can have a masterful impact in a country like Nepal. Then we will also, in depth, discuss about our project, ECube with its features, qualities and advantages to the Nepali community.</p><br><h2 id="_1-2-history-of-satellite" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-2-history-of-satellite"><span>1.2 History of Satellite</span></a></h2><br><p>The history of satellites dates back to the late 1940s and early 1950s, when the Soviet Union and the United States began launching them into orbit for military and scientific purposes. The first successful satellite launch was conducted by the Soviet Union’s Sputnik 1 in 1957. The cold war between the US and the Soviet Union saw remarkable advancements in satellite technology. Even though the primary function of Sputnik-1 was to demonstrate orbit and transmit radio signals, it has had a massive influence on the overall development of satellite technologies worldwide. Since then, usage of satellites for earth observation (remote sensing, weather forecasting and observations eg. Landsats, Sentinel-1, Copernicus program etc.) , telecommunications (eg. Intelsat, Iridium, OneWeb, etc.), navigation (eg. GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, NavIC etc.) and technological innovations (GRACE, JWST, Curiosity, HST etc.) In recent days, incorporation of satellite data has been fairly common. Usage of satellite data in agriculture, urban planning and infrastructure, disaster management, environment monitoring, communication sector and internet etc has provided valuable data and helped decision-making in various sectors.</p><p>      Satellites can come in different shapes, sizes and also weight. Based on their dimensions large satellites may refer to the satellites weighing several tons, medium sized satellites may range from few tons to few hundred kgs, small satellites may range from few hundred to few kgs, and miniaturised satellites (picosatellites and fempto satellites)which could at most weigh a few kgs. In this book, we are mainly focused on nanosatellites (CubeSats) which are the subset of small satellites.</p><br><h2 id="_1-3-cubesats" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-3-cubesats"><span>1.3 CubeSats</span></a></h2><br><p>A CubeSat is a type of small satellite for space research that usually has a volume of exactly 10 cm<sup>3</sup> (10* 10* 10 cm, which is called 1U) cube, has a mass not exceeding 1.33 kilograms (for 1U), and typically uses commercial off-the-shelf electronic components. The CubeSat concept was first proposed by professors, Dr. Bob Twiggs (of California Polytechnic State University) and Dr. Jordi Puig-Suari (of Stanford University), in 1999 as an educational tool for university students. The goal was to make space technology more accessible and affordable to universities, research institutions, and small businesses. The first CubeSat, called CubeSat-1, was launched in June 2003 as a secondary payload on a Russian rocket. Since then, hundreds of CubeSats have been launched by various countries and organisations. CubeSats have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their low cost, ease of development and deployment, and versatility. Because of their small size, CubeSats can be launched as secondary payloads on larger rockets, which reduces the cost of getting them into space. Additionally, CubeSats can be easily customised to fit specific mission requirements, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.</p><p>      CubeSats are used for a variety of missions, such as Earth observation, technology demonstration, and scientific research. They are also used for education and outreach, allowing students and amateur enthusiasts to participate in space research. Some CubeSats are even designed for commercial applications, such as remote sensing and telecommunications. The CubeSat standard has also been adopted by several space agencies, including NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), which have developed CubeSat launch programs to support the development of CubeSat technology and provide opportunities for CubeSat missions. In recent years, CubeSats have also been used in interplanetary missions. Mars Cube One (MarCO) was primarily used to transmit data from NASA’s InSight lander in real-time, during and after the landing procedure, proving the potential for CubeSats to serve as cost-effective communication relay platforms for future missions.</p><p>      When it comes to the CubeSats system, it can be divided into two main categories: Commercial off the shelf (COTS) and custom-designed. COTSCubeSats are pre-manufactured, pre-tested and pre-qualified systems that can be purchased and launched in a relatively short time frame. While custom-designed CubeSats are built from scratch, with specific require ments and mission objectives in mind. These types of CubeSats require more resources, time and effort to design, build, and test. In terms of future trends, it is expected that CubeSats will continue to evolve in terms of capabilities and performance. New technologies such as miniaturized sensors, advanced communication systems, and more efficient propulsion systems will enable CubeSats to perform more complex and capable missions. Additionally, CubeSats are also expected to play a larger role in the field of space-based Internet of Things (IoT), providing connectivity and data transmission capabilities to remote areas of the planet.</p><br><h3 id="_1-3-1-features-and-advantages" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-3-1-features-and-advantages"><span>1.3.1 Features and Advantages</span></a></h3><br><br><img src="/assets/nan-Dwra7uXR.png"><div style="position:relative;min-height:10vh;"><p style="position:absolute;width:100%;text-align:center;"> Figure 1.1: Number of CubeSats launches so far and the prediction of the CubeSats launches till 2025. ([1]) </p></div><br><p>As shown in Figure 1.1, the past 10 years has seen growth in the number in CubeSats. Initially envisioned for graduate level technology development, in recent days there has been surge in interest in CubeSats from commercial and government entities. One of the key factors while making a CubeSat is the process of standardization and modularity. The specifications that are required to follow while making a CubeSats has been published in extensive details in the Cal Poly Institute’s CubeSat Design Specification ([2]). This has enabled on the availability of COTS components that has contributed a lot in making of a CubeSat easier. In the CubeSats industry, almost all the components required while manufacturing are COTS. Components like batteries, solar panels, magnetic torque rods, reaction wheels, cameras, on board computers, receiving and board-casting antennas and even CubeSat buses are available in the market readily. Although, a CubeSat payload is often unique for each satellite, all the other components that are required in the mission are seen to take the advantage of being COTS.</p><p>      Most of the CubeSats missions are considered to have lower risk than the conventional satellites from a cost perspective. With the total amount of capital required to make a conventional satellite, it is possible to make hundreds of CubeSats. The reduced costs of CubeSats has permitted small enterprises and universities to put satellites in orbit. Institutions have been able to manufacture CubeSats for costs as low as $50,000 to $200,000. The launch costs are also seen to be around $100,000 per U, which can be subsidized. This is significantly lower than the capital required for the manufacture of a conventional satellite ([3]).</p><p>      There has been instances when CubeSats have provided a significant path for advancing different science missions. Several Earth observation missions and remote sensing missions have benefited from CubeSats. Since, CubeSats supports improved revisit times as many satellite can be lunched instead of one conventional one, Earth observation missions have been shown to be feasible with CubeSats. Microwave Atmospheric Satellite (MicroMAS-1) CubeSat is an example of such Earth observation CubeSats that helped fulfill a role similar to the one that Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) had. The latter was on a conventional satellite called Suomi NPP satellite and weighed about 85kgs (the sensor) compared to the former which was a 3U CubeSat ([4]).</p><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/cubesats-BtdJTYow.png"></div><div style="position:relative;min-height:10vh;"><p style="position:absolute;width:100%;text-align:center;"> Figure 1.2: 1U CubeSat (on the left) and 3U CubeSat (on the right) with their size dimensions. ([2]) </p></div><p>      CubeSats can play a greater role in continuous monitoring of global geophysical processes from space. The cost disparity from the conventional satellite, where an average overall CubeSat cost would be approximately about 0.5 million dollars to a conventional satellite whose cost would be approximately more than 100 million dollars, itself is the first reason why this technology has to be researched and understood better([2]). That rules out developing countries as they don’t have budget to deploy a conventional satellite. Hence, CubeSats are generally preferred by developing countries to exhibit their new technologies, encourage the newer generation to be space savvy and to get hands on experience with space technologies. Also, as mentioned before, the risk at failure, provided by a CubeSat is significantly lower than a conventional satellite. In addition to that, new technologies can also be experimented with CubeSats for the sole purpose of the observation of the Earth’s gravity field. The mission design concerned with a CubeSat is also significantly less than a conventional satellite, that provides the freedom to be more dynamic with the technology that is available.</p><h3 id="_1-3-2-restrictions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-3-2-restrictions"><span>1.3.2 Restrictions</span></a></h3><p>As the advantages of CubeSats have been many, there has been some issues as well. The most prominent is one regarding their Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) constraints. Since CubeSats are relatively small and they have strict guidelines about their size, weight, power and volume, their usages can be limited as well. The total wattage of power available in CubeSats limits the performance of subsystems that could be added and also the nature of payload. The communication subsystem is also heavily affected by the power limitation of a CubeSat. The orbit selection is also limited because that is also determined by the launchers that can take 4 CubeSats as their secondary payloads.</p><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/stat-9qkZG75I.png" style="text-align:center;"></div><div style="position:relative;min-height:10vh;"><p style="position:absolute;width:100%;text-align:center;"> Figure 1.2: 1U CubeSat (on the left) and 3U CubeSat (on the right) with their size dimensions. ([2]) </p></div><br><p>The propulsion systems are also seen to be difficult to have on a CubeSat because of the cost, size, mass constraints and also the administrative burden of getting permission and meeting requirements of such systems. CubeSats have also seen higher failure rates than the conventional satellites. CubeSats are not thoroughly tested and vetted as their conventional counterparts and that means often times they are sent into orbit without as rigorous testing as the conventional satellites. Also, since most of the CubeSats are made as a university projects as an experimental projects, there is always a risk of the CubeSats failing. Figure 1.3 shows the current status of the CubeSats that have been deployed and the number is significantly higher than the conventional satellites ([3]).</p><br><h2 id="_1-4-antarikchya-pratisthan-nepal" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-4-antarikchya-pratisthan-nepal"><span>1.4 Antarikchya Pratisthan Nepal</span></a></h2><br><p>Antarikchya Pratisthan Nepal (APN) is a non-profit organization that aims to develop the space industry and promote space education in Nepal.</p><p>2015&#39;s earthquake in Nepal showed that the country needed before/after images and alternative mediums of communication.
