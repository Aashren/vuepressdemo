## 1.1 Introduction

In this document, we will briefly discuss about the history of satellites. We will also familirize
ourselves with different types of satellite missions. We will also have an overview of CubeSats
and how they can have a masterful impact in a country like Nepal. Then we will also, in 
depth, discuss about our project, ECube with its features, qualities and advantages to the
Nepali community.

## 1.2 History of Satellite 
<br>


The history of satellites dates back to the late 1940s and early 1950s, when the Soviet Union
and the United States began launching them into orbit for military and scientific purposes.
The first successful satellite launch was conducted by the Soviet Union’s Sputnik 1 in 1957.
The cold war between the US and the Soviet Union saw remarkable advancements in satellite
technology. Even though the primary function of Sputnik-1 was to demonstrate orbit and
transmit radio signals, it has had a massive influence on the overall development of satellite
technologies worldwide. Since then, usage of satellites for earth observation (remote sensing,
weather forecasting and observations eg. Landsats, Sentinel-1, Copernicus program etc.) ,
telecommunications (eg. Intelsat, Iridium, OneWeb, etc.), navigation (eg. GPS, GLONASS,
Galileo, BeiDou, NavIC etc.) and technological innovations (GRACE, JWST, Curiosity, HST
etc.) In recent days, incorporation of satellite data has been fairly common. Usage of satellite
data in agriculture, urban planning and infrastructure, disaster management, environment
monitoring, communication sector and internet etc has provided valuable data and helped
decision-making in various sectors.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Satellites can come in different shapes, sizes and also weight. Based on their dimensions
large satellites may refer to the satellites weighing several tons, medium sized satellites may
range from few tons to few hundred kgs, small satellites may range from few hundred to
few kgs, and miniaturised satellites (picosatellites and fempto satellites)which could at most
weigh a few kgs. In this book, we are mainly focused on nanosatellites (CubeSats) which are
the subset of small satellites.

<br>

## 1.3 CubeSats

<br>

A CubeSat is a type of small satellite for space research that usually has a volume of exactly
10 cm<sup>3</sup> (10* 10* 10 cm, which is called 1U) cube, has a mass not exceeding 1.33 kilograms
(for 1U), and typically uses commercial off-the-shelf electronic components. The CubeSat
concept was first proposed by professors, Dr. Bob Twiggs (of California Polytechnic State
University) and Dr. Jordi Puig-Suari (of Stanford University), in 1999 as an educational
tool for university students. The goal was to make space technology more accessible and
affordable to universities, research institutions, and small businesses. The first CubeSat, called
CubeSat-1, was launched in June 2003 as a secondary payload on a Russian rocket. Since then,
hundreds of CubeSats have been launched by various countries and organisations. CubeSats
have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their low cost, ease of development
and deployment, and versatility. Because of their small size, CubeSats can be launched as
secondary payloads on larger rockets, which reduces the cost of getting them into space.
Additionally, CubeSats can be easily customised to fit specific mission requirements, making
them suitable for a wide range of applications.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CubeSats are used for a variety of missions, such as Earth observation, technology 
demonstration, and scientific research. They are also used for education and outreach, allowing
students and amateur enthusiasts to participate in space research. Some CubeSats are even
designed for commercial applications, such as remote sensing and telecommunications. The
CubeSat standard has also been adopted by several space agencies, including NASA, the
European Space Agency (ESA), and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA),
which have developed CubeSat launch programs to support the development of CubeSat
technology and provide opportunities for CubeSat missions. In recent years, CubeSats have
also been used in interplanetary missions. Mars Cube One (MarCO) was primarily used
to transmit data from NASA’s InSight lander in real-time, during and after the landing
procedure, proving the potential for CubeSats to serve as cost-effective communication relay
platforms for future missions.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When it comes to the CubeSats system, it can be divided into two main categories: 
Commercial off the shelf (COTS) and custom-designed. COTSCubeSats are pre-manufactured,
pre-tested and pre-qualified systems that can be purchased and launched in a relatively short
time frame. While custom-designed CubeSats are built from scratch, with specific require
ments and mission objectives in mind. These types of CubeSats require more resources, time
and effort to design, build, and test. In terms of future trends, it is expected that CubeSats
will continue to evolve in terms of capabilities and performance. New technologies such
as miniaturized sensors, advanced communication systems, and more efficient propulsion
systems will enable CubeSats to perform more complex and capable missions. Additionally,
CubeSats are also expected to play a larger role in the field of space-based Internet of Things
(IoT), providing connectivity and data transmission capabilities to remote areas of the planet.

### 1.3.1 Features and Advantages
<br>

   </p>
</div>
<br>

As shown in Figure 1.1, the past 10 years has seen growth in the number in CubeSats. Initially
envisioned for graduate level technology development, in recent days there has been surge
in interest in CubeSats from commercial and government entities. One of the key factors
while making a CubeSat is the process of standardization and modularity. The specifications
that are required to follow while making a CubeSats has been published in extensive details
in the Cal Poly Institute’s CubeSat Design Specification ([2]). This has enabled on the
availability of COTS components that has contributed a lot in making of a CubeSat easier. In
the CubeSats industry, almost all the components required while manufacturing are COTS.
Components like batteries, solar panels, magnetic torque rods, reaction wheels, cameras, on
board computers, receiving and board-casting antennas and even CubeSat buses are available
in the market readily. Although, a CubeSat payload is often unique for each satellite, all the
other components that are required in the mission are seen to take the advantage of being
COTS.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most of the CubeSats missions are considered to have lower risk than the conventional
satellites from a cost perspective. With the total amount of capital required to make a
conventional satellite, it is possible to make hundreds of CubeSats. The reduced costs of
CubeSats has permitted small enterprises and universities to put satellites in orbit. Institutions
have been able to manufacture CubeSats for costs as low as $50,000 to $200,000. The launch
costs are also seen to be around $100,000 per U, which can be subsidized. This is significantly
lower than the capital required for the manufacture of a conventional satellite ([3]).

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There has been instances when CubeSats have provided a significant path for advancing
different science missions. Several Earth observation missions and remote sensing missions
have benefited from CubeSats. Since, CubeSats supports improved revisit times as many
satellite can be lunched instead of one conventional one, Earth observation missions have
been shown to be feasible with CubeSats. Microwave Atmospheric Satellite (MicroMAS-1)
CubeSat is an example of such Earth observation CubeSats that helped fulfill a role similar
to the one that Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) had. The latter was on
a conventional satellite called Suomi NPP satellite and weighed about 85kgs (the sensor)
compared to the former which was a 3U CubeSat ([4]).

   </p>
</div>


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CubeSats can play a greater role in continuous monitoring of global geophysical processes
from space. The cost disparity from the conventional satellite, where an average overall
CubeSat cost would be approximately about 0.5 million dollars to a conventional satellite
whose cost would be approximately more than 100 million dollars, itself is the first reason why
this technology has to be researched and understood better([2]). That rules out developing
countries as they don’t have budget to deploy a conventional satellite. Hence, CubeSats are
generally preferred by developing countries to exhibit their new technologies, encourage the
newer generation to be space savvy and to get hands on experience with space technologies.
Also, as mentioned before, the risk at failure, provided by a CubeSat is significantly lower
than a conventional satellite. In addition to that, new technologies can also be experimented
with CubeSats for the sole purpose of the observation of the Earth’s gravity field. The mission
design concerned with a CubeSat is also significantly less than a conventional satellite, that
provides the freedom to be more dynamic with the technology that is available.


### 1.3.2 Restrictions

As the advantages of CubeSats have been many, there has been some issues as well. The most
prominent is one regarding their Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) constraints. Since CubeSats
are relatively small and they have strict guidelines about their size, weight, power and volume,
their usages can be limited as well. The total wattage of power available in CubeSats limits
the performance of subsystems that could be added and also the nature of payload. The
communication subsystem is also heavily affected by the power limitation of a CubeSat. The
orbit selection is also limited because that is also determined by the launchers that can take
4 CubeSats as their secondary payloads.

   </p>
</div>
<br>

The propulsion systems are also seen to be difficult to have on a CubeSat because of the cost, size, mass constraints and also the administrative
burden of getting permission and meeting requirements of such systems. CubeSats have
also seen higher failure rates than the conventional satellites. CubeSats are not thoroughly
tested and vetted as their conventional counterparts and that means often times they are sent
into orbit without as rigorous testing as the conventional satellites. Also, since most of the
CubeSats are made as a university projects as an experimental projects, there is always a risk
of the CubeSats failing. Figure 1.3 shows the current status of the CubeSats that have been
deployed and the number is significantly higher than the conventional satellites ([3]).

## 1.4 Antarikchya Pratisthan Nepal
<br>

Antarikchya Pratisthan Nepal (APN) is a non-profit organization that aims to develop the space industry and promote space education in Nepal. 

2015's earthquake in Nepal showed that the country needed before/after images and alternative mediums of communication. NepaliSat-1, led by Dr. Abhas Maskey, took the first step towards disaster mitigation by testing a self-built camera and communication module in space. Shortly after, Antarikchya Pratisthan Nepal was established. Since then, APN has been working to train the next generation of space leaders, tinkers, and designers to use the tools from space to solve problems on Earth while we simultaneously, focus on educating the general masses on space technology and its relevance to society.

Noteworthy is APN’s work in projects such as Munal, Nepal’s First High-School Cube Sat built and developed in-house; NEXT_GEN_CUBUS, a next-generation Satellite Bus system for CubeSat; PHI Project; Slippers2Sat, an ongoing middle-school CubeSat project including students from marginalized Chepang community; and many more. APN has also jointly collaborated and developed A Space Systems Laboratory at KUHS for the MUNAL Satellite. To inspire broader groups, APN has also developed outreach kits such as SastoCube, an educational non-flight satellite incorporating a complete end-to-end system of an entire CubeSat ecosystem; PaperSat, an innovative initiative designed for children of age 5+ to construct a satellite model using paper and plastic parts, and The Young Satellite Book; a children’s book inspired by Nepali Sat- 1.

Antarikchya Pratisthan Nepal aims to launch Nepal’s first astronaut by 2050. This vision of ours is quoted as “Vision 2050”. As Antarikchya Pratisthan Nepal continues to direct towards the organization’s ambitious goals, the organization also looks out for collaboration and partnerships as we believe forging alliances with international space agencies, research institutions, and industry partners can allow us to leverage expertise, resources, and opportunities to accelerate progress towards its objectives. Through collaboration, APN seeks to access cutting-edge technologies, exchange best practices, and amplify its impact on the global stage.
