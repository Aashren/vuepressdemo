## 4.1 Conclusion

<br>
<br>

After providing a dozen of ECube’s workshops and trainings, APN can successfully remark
that the interest in space sciences and satellite technology has definitely increased. The
trainees were from different background, age-groups and locations and response received
from them was encouraging. Not only did the trainees became well versed with space science
and technology, but also with mission design and development where they pitched their own
ideas and gave out their own recommendations. ECube was the first step for any individual
to familiarize themselves with satellite tech and what they could accomplish.

The students were seen to have improved knowledge about satellite mission design and
satellite development processes. As the trainers supported the trainees (students) with various
experiments, what was seen was that, their enthusiasm, knowledge and interest increased as
the days went on. The biggest shift was seen when students, who were extremely optimistic
before (while thinking about their own satellite mission) be more realistic and grounded with
CubeSats and their SWaP requirements. That signified that the students had indeed analyzed
the status quo of CubeSats and then modified their missions in-accordance of what could be
done. That was refreshing to witness.

The overall objective of ECube was not just give theoretical knowledge of space sciences
and tech to the students but also compliment the lectures with practical work so that the
students get the hang of, ’learning by doing methods’. Sufficed to say, the objective was
fulfilled because students got an idea of what goes around behind the scenes of building
a satellite. Also, we tried imparting the knowledge of programming to our students, so
that they can also have an experience with the basic sensors incorporated in the various
subsystems. Also, we kept fairly simple with the development process (with the structure
and PCBs) for all the components there.

APN set out with this venture of training future leaders, with the hope that, people
who are interested about Satellite technology, can actually get a cohesive, condensed and
captivating program that would furthermore empower them. From what has been seen, APN
has managed to do that successfully. Specially in Nepali community, there was this void
where people would learn theories about everything but would not know how to employ
such knowledge. With this program, that proverbial void, seems to be filling up, because
people can actually make use of the things that they have learned.

## 4.2 Recommendations
    
The trainers of APN noticed that, some of the content of the training program was found to
be complicated. The core space sciences and satellite sciences were found to be demanding.
That was specifically seen when the trainers were introducing new construct to the students.
Later, after passage of some time, that was seen to have been mitigated. So, the trainers
recommend to keep it simpler and keep the trainers background in mind. Also, for the
processes like soldering and familiarizing a student with PCB boards, they also have to be
given the knowledge about basic electronics and to have some sort of hands-on experiences
with soldering rod and coil. They should also be briefed about caution while dealing with
instruments as such.

The other thing, was also concerning a satellite mission design. It was seen that the trainers
had to constantly go back to CubeSats features and its restriction and also the socio-economic
structure of Nepal, to urge them to design a mission as such that would have a lasting impact
to everyone. That also proved to be tricky situation to navigate to. One had to be realistic
and yet not crush the dreams of young leaders. That also had to be considered and also dealt
with. We urge that whoever is concerned with following this blueprint to be aware of that.
Moving on, one of the main features of ECube is that there are three boards with various
subsystems integrated in it. For the payload part, there is a base where a payload can be
housed, but the payload however, remains absent. That is where the program encourages the
students to make their own mission and look for the applicable payload to be added there.
That sometimes is seen not to have matched with the expectations of the students for they
expect that there would be a payload that they would work with. That also was seen to be a
common occurrence. To add on to that, programming part was also received that way. Due to
myriad of logistical problems, training for programming was difficult to achieve. Majority
of students didn’t have a personal computer to practice programming skills to begin with,
also the knowledge of Arduino language was also seen to be rare. That all were one of the
challenges that the trainers had to overcome.

Thus, there are some parts in the program that has to be expanded and revised. But, looking
at the bigger picture, it seems that the ECube ETSP program has definitely empowered,
encouraged and educated young leaders and APN can hope attaining the fulfillment of it’s
Vision 2050.
